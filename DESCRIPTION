Description: CellScape facilitates interactive browsing of single cell
    clonal evolution datasets. The tool requires two main inputs: (i) the
    genomic content of each single cell in the form of either copy number
    segments or targeted mutation values, and (ii) a single cell
    phylogeny. Phylogenetic formats can vary from dendrogram-like
    phylogenies with leaf nodes to evolutionary model-derived phylogenies
    with observed or latent internal nodes. The CellScape phylogeny is
    flexibly input as a table of source-target edges to support arbitrary
    representations, where each node may or may not have associated
    genomic data. The output of CellScape is an interactive interface
    displaying a single cell phylogeny and a cell-by-locus genomic heatmap
    representing the mutation status in each cell for each locus.
